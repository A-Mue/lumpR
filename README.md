# LUMP

R package: Landscape Unit Mapping Program


## DESCRIPTION

This project deals with an R-package called "LUMP". The package provides functions for a semi-automated approach of the delineation and description of landscape units and partition into terrain components. It can be used for the pre-processing of semi-distributed large-scale hydrological and erosion models using catena-representation (WASA-SED, CATFLOW). It is closely connected to and uses functionalities of GRASS GIS. Additional pre-processing tools beyond the scope of the original LUMP are included.
